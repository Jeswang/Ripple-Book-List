## What is this?

If you feel the website is slow, you can try using this to watch ripple's books in a clean terminal. 

[ripple/ripple-lib](https://github.com/ripple/ripple-lib) is a very clean library. I read the OrderBook part and just write several lines. Parsing related code comes from [ripple/ripple-watch](https://github.com/ripple/ripple-watch).

## Set up instructions

    npm install ripple-lib blessed extend
    node show_books.js
